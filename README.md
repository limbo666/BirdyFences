This fork changed to a few points:
1. The json file moved to the same path with executable. 
2. The first fence line is cretaed during the first execution.
3. A program icon was added to the executable

So the following guide is not applicable anymore
~~In the first fence creation, you need to do it manually~~
~~go to userdirectory\Birdy Fences and open fences.json~~
~~put this to inside the file:~~
~~`[{"Title":"New Fence","X":0,"Y":0,"Width":200,"Height":200,"ItemsType":"Data","Items":[]}]`~~
