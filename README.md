BirdyFences is alternative to the StarDock's Fences originaly created by HAKANKOKCU <br>
This fork has been **significantly enhanced and optimized** for better performance and stability.

## Changes in v1.1

1. The json file moved to the same path with executable. 
2. The first fence line is created on json file during the first execution.
3. A program icon was added to the executable. The icon updated on version 1.1
4. Error handlers on: move action, program execution, empty json file.
5. Added minimal about screen.
6. Tray icon.
7. Program exit option on right click and tray context menu.

## Changes in v1.3

1. Better management on new fence creation. The fence is now created where the mouse is located.
2. Shortcuts are not relying in the existence of original shortcuts which are dropped into the fence, this allows the user to get rid of the originals once the fence has the icon.
3. Shortcut execution arguments (if any) are detected and replicated into fence shortcuts.
4. Error handlers added to detect target type.
5. Added visual effects on icon click and icon removal.
